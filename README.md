## Demo blockchain

this is a simple demo blockchain coded in go lang. It can store time, index, hashes and some data. I am storing name and grade in block linking them in a chain.

## installation and running 
* Install go
* Install go package - Spew, Gorilla/mux and Gotdotenv 
* edit as you want or just run 

```bash
go run main.go
```

It will start a local server where you can see genesis block displayed as json record. 

you can use postman or similar application to do some get/post and see how new records are appened to this chain. 


## to do 

Build and deploy on cloud for demo.
